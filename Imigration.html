    <h2>Immigration Facts </h2>
    <ul id="myList">
      <li>If you are an American citizen, you can immigrate your spouse, parents, children under the age of 21, children 21 years and older who are single, married, divorced, and widowed.</li>
      <li>If you are an American citizen, you can petition for your fiancée.</li>
      <li>If you are a permanent resident, you can immigrate with your spouse, single children under the age of 21 and children over the age of 21 who are single, divorced, or widowed. </li>
      <li>If you are a permanent resident and you petitioned for your spouse or children under the age of 21, your children or spouse may qualify for a “V” visa and a work permit if you petitioned for them before December 21, 2000, and they have been waiting for a visa for three years or more.</li>
      <li>If you have been a permanent resident for five years in the United States you could qualify for American citizenship, and if you have been a permanent resident for three years in the United States you could qualify if you are married to an American citizen.</li>
      <li>If one parent becomes an American citizen their children under the age of 18 could obtain their American citizenship automatically.</li>
      <li>Those persons who have been permanent residents for 15 years and are 55 years of age may take their citizenship exam in their own language and persons who have been permanent residents for 20 years and are over 50 have the same opportunity.</li>
      <li>If you have been charged with a felony, or two or more misdemeanors and you apply for American citizenship you may be placed into removal (deportation) proceedings by immigration.</li>
      <li>If your American citizen spouse has abused you physically, mentally, or sexually, you may adjust your status without permission from him/her.</li>
      <li>If you have suffered persecution in your country because of your political opinion, your membership in a particular social group, your nationality, or your religious beliefs you may qualify for political asylum.  You only have one year from the time you were admitted into the United States to apply for political asylum.</li>
      <li>If you have an occupation or trade that no other American citizen or permanent resident wants to do, you may qualify for permanent residency through a work (labor) certification.</li>
      <li>If you entered with a tourist visa from Cuba you may qualify for permanent residency and a work permit after a year from the date you entered the United States.</li>
      <li>If you are a permanent resident and you commit a felony or two misdemeanors, or domestic violence you could be removed and lose your permanent residency in the United States.</li>
      <li>If your immigration papers have taken longer than the required time to process, and you have tried to contact immigration and they have not yet resolved your case, you have a right to contact your congressman or congresswoman for help in resolving and inquiring into what has happened to your case.</li>
      <li>If you have a work permit, you should apply for an extension within 90 days of your work permit expires.</li>
      <li>If you change your address and you have an application pending with immigration you should write a letter to the immigration service concerning your change of address. Just changing your address with the postal service or using your new address on an immigration petition is not enough.</li>
      <li>The affidavit of support is not needed if the parent or spouse has worked 10 years or 40 qualifying quarters in the United States before the child reached 18 years of age or during marriage to the alien spouse.</li>
      <li>If your child has turned 14 and received his/her permanent residency before the age of fourteen, he/she should apply for a new permanent residency card.</li>
      <li>If you are male and become a permanent resident between the ages of 18 and 26 you are required under United States law to register with the Selective Service.</li>
      <li>Our immigration program is accredited by the Immigration and our staff is accredited by the Department of Justice.</li>
