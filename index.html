      <h4>DEPORTATION/REMOVAL DEFENSE</h4>
      <p>Whereas in the criminal justice system, all defendants are provided with a free lawyer if they cannot afford one, in the immigration system, immigrants facing deportation (also known as “removal”) do not have the right to court-appointed counsel. As a result, the majority of immigrants in removal proceedings in Immigration Court are unrepresented.  Lack of legal representation tends to have a profound impact on an immigrant’s ability to remain in the United States and immigrants with legal representation are much more likely to succeed in Immigration Court. In limited circumstances, PWLA is able to represent clients facing deportation in Immigration Court and help them identify and present all available defenses to their removal. Because of the enormous backlog in the immigration court system, these cases can take several years before they reach a final decision. It is very important to know this and make sure to make every possible arrangement for legal representation before such situations.</p>
